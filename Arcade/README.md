# Arcade
Arcade is a CSCI1302 (Introduction to Programming in Java II) final project that was developed with the help of Hazim Mohamed. The project consists of a compilation of two very popular retro games: Tetris and Minesweeper. Keeping true to the game, both were developed to nearly 100% authenticity when considering funcationality. Minesweeper remains true to its origins both in design and functionality.
